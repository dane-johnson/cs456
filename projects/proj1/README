`make` should build all the executables for you, as well as
a unit testing and benchmarking tool I was using. The executables
you are interested in are `quicksort_array`, `quicksort_list`,
`mergesort_array` and `mergesort_list`. They all have the command
line options specified in the spec.

NOTICE if you are getting crashes or missing values in the sorts, make
sure there is a single newline character at the end of the input file.
